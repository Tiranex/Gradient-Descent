# Gradient Descent Webapp

This is a web application that utilizes a library called three.js to create visual representations of multiple mathematical functions. The user can interact with the application by selecting a point, and the app will then generate a path based on the gradient descent algorithm. In other words, it will calculate the steepest descent path to optimize a given function.
